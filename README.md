# bible-app

The Bible app is composed of two main components: a client application and a file server.
- [/client](https://github.com/Razzula/bible-app/tree/main/client)
- [/server](https://github.com/Razzula/bible-app/tree/main/server)

You can install and configure each of these components separately, following the instructions in their respective README files.

If both are configured, you can run them both together using `bun run dev` in the root directory (you will need to run `bun install` here, too, for the concurrency package).

## Demo

You can run a lightweight, static demo of the application [here](https://razzula.github.io/bible-app/).
